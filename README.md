User story
- - - - - - 
My name is Armen Kazaryan, I am student in AUA and I am working simultaneously.

I have problems with my time management and I need to organize my time to be more productive.
I have some problems with the memorizing my doings for a next several days and I can forget something which could be fatal for my work or my education.

I have tried to make some graphics by hand in the paper but many times I lost them or forget to edit. 

This application will help me to be more punctual and helps me not to forget my actions to do.
It is more comfortable to have your editable graphic in your smartphone which will send you notifications and which will patiently suggest you to get some rest when it needed.
